&gt;&gt;# &gt;&gt;# TkGoldberg.tcl &gt;&gt;# by Keith Vetter, March 13,
2003 &gt;&gt;# &gt;&gt;# “Man will always find a difficult means to perform
a simple task” &gt;&gt;# Rube Goldberg &gt;&gt;# &gt;&gt;# Reproduced here
with permission. &gt;&gt;#
&gt;&gt;##+#################################################################
&gt;&gt;# &gt;&gt;# Keith Vetter 2003-03-21: this started out as a simple
little program &gt;&gt;# but was so much fun that it grew and grew. So I
apologize about the &gt;&gt;# size but I just couldn&#39;t resist sharing
it. &gt;&gt;# &gt;&gt;# This is a whizzlet that does a Rube Goldberg type
animation, the &gt;&gt;# design of which comes from an New Years e-card
from IncrediMail. &gt;&gt;# That version had nice sound effects which I
eschewed. On the other &gt;&gt;# hand, that version was in black and white
(actually dark blue and &gt;&gt;# light blue) and this one is fully
colorized. &gt;&gt;# &gt;&gt;# One thing I learned from this project is
that drawing filled complex &gt;&gt;# objects on a canvas is really hard.
More often than not I had to &gt;&gt;# draw each item twice–once with the
desired fill color but no &gt;&gt;# outline, and once with no fill but with
the outline. Another trick &gt;&gt;# is erasing by drawing with the
background color. Having a flood fill &gt;&gt;# command would have been
extremely helpful. &gt;&gt;# &gt;&gt;# Two wiki pages were extremely
helpful: Drawing rounded rectangles &gt;&gt;# which I generalized into
Drawing rounded polygons, and regular &gt;&gt;# polygons which allowed me
to convert ovals and arcs into polygons &gt;&gt;# which could then be
rotated (see Canvas Rotation). I also wrote &gt;&gt;# Named Colors to aid
in the color selection. &gt;&gt;# &gt;&gt;# I could comment on the code,
but it&#39;s just 26 state machines with &gt;&gt;# lots of canvas create
and move calls.</p>
